I had travelled on 1st January 2014 with my cousins. Its just near the 2nd flyover exit from Mumbai on Mumbai - Pune expressway. It is a so so hotel. Its not a resort & cannot be compared with club mahindra. But definetly it is better than their earlier leased hotel of Mayur.

",4,Pleasant surprise,"
We visited Yercaud with least expectations, but the stay at Sterling's was definitely a pleasant one and better than expected. Though Yercaud is a small place and at a much lower height in comparison to most hill stations, the improvements at Sterling Resort and the remarkable and positive change in the Infrastructure, Quality and Service standards, of various aspects did...

Thanks to Trip Advisor's reviews, I chose this one for my stay at Yercaud and decision was right. Landed here post my Ooty visit immediately after Christmas.
Excellent location with quite, peaceful surroundings.
My family really likes the buffet spread and we had all our meals in the hotel itself instead of venturing out! Not quite good and should have...

Great resort with very good amenities only drawback for some people may be that its far from the action area (swargdwar). But if you are looking for a peaceful holiday with good amenities and great hospitality this is the place 4 u. A round trip to swargdwar in a auto costs a mere 200 Rs.

The huge property is the best located hotel in Puri if you want to unwind & relax, with its excellent service staff (reception &dining room). Even the GM, Mr. Paul & his executive Mr. Ranjeet, gave personal attention to make my stay memorable.

The main issue with this resort is that there is a river flowing between the resort and beach, so every-time you wanna go to the beach you have to get on a small plastic boat on a slippery sand bag jetty to go to the beach. It is not possible to go to the beach at all with small kids...
