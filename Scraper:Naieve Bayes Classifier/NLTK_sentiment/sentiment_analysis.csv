Except its location, nothing was good about it.
they dont provide shampoo, they dont change linen & towel everyday & worst part is that they only have a very small geyser for each room which supplies only 1/2 bucket of hot water after which you have to wait for another 30 min for another 1/2 bucket of hot water

Villagio Inn is standard, well-maintained 3* category property. The resort staff is courteous and helpful. The food quality is reasonable, but food pricing is somewhat expensive.

I enjoyed our stay at this new resort of Sterling. The services were very good, with helpful staff and Management. Rooms are well-appointed and clean.
The only area of short-coming was that there was no a la carte food service. For a foodie like me, that is not very satisfactory. Hope Sterling upgrades their kitchen service quickly.

Goa Villagio is located in South Goa a cool and calm place. Near to Betalbatim beach almost like a private beach, where you get privacy and place away from Mad rush. Staff and service are good.

This is a sprawling property with large rooms and suites.
Very courteous staff who are eager to attend to your needs. We had placed a request for an early check-in which was accommodated.

Villagio Inn is standard, well-maintained 3* category property. The resort staff is courteous and helpful. The food quality is reasonable, but food pricing is somewhat expensive. The resort is located in a quiet, serene area within 10-12 minutes walking distance to a wonderful beach. The rooms are average.

I enjoyed our stay at this new resort of Sterling. The services were very good, with helpful staff and Management. Rooms are well-appointed and clean.
The only area of short-coming was that there was no a la carte food service. For a foodie like me, that is not very satisfactory. Hope Sterling upgrades their kitchen service quickly.

Stayed there this February. Overall, it was a decent experience.
NO WIFI. And hot water wasnt available 24 hours. It is a Sterling resort so only stay here if you are member. Not worth otherwise. Rooms are spacious. They even have a heater.
Wonderful views as well. Restaurant was decent, and a little expensive.
